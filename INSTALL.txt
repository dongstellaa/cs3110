To Run 2048:
- In your powershell, go to the root directory of the folder.
- Run dune build
- Then run: make play
- Follow as prompted! If unclear:
  - Selecting a gamemode:
    - score mode = enter the score you want to play until.
    - normal mode = get the 2048 tile to win
    - easy mode = get the 512 tile to win
    - reverse mode = start with the 2048 tile, combining tiles halves them. get
      to 1 to win.
    - invisible mode = only grid, no numbers, try to get 2048.
    - hangman mode = a round of hangman initiates after every move. lose hangman
      and you lose the game, try to get 2048.
    - unlimited = like the classic game, play until you lose.
  - only wasd works as moves. 
  - after you win or lose, hit q to quit. nothing else will work.

ty!
