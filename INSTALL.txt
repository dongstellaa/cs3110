To Run 2048:
- In your powershell, go to the root directory of the folder.

  - Selecting a gamemode:
    - score mode = enter the score (the actual number) you want to play until.
    - normal mode = press n, get the 2048 tile to win
    - easy mode = press e, get the 512 tile to win
    - reverse mode = press r, start with the 2048 tile, combining tiles halves 
      them. get to 1 to win.
    - invisible mode = press i, only grid, no numbers, try to get 2048.
    - hangman mode = press h, a round of hangman initiates after every move. 
      lose hangman and you lose the game, try to get 2048.
    - unlimited = press any other key, like the classic game, play until you 
      lose.
  - only wasd works as moves. 
  - after you win or lose, hit q to quit. nothing else will work.
