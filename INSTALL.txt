To Run 2048:
- In your powershell, go to the root directory of the folder.
- Run dune build
- Then run: make play
- Currently only the left and right controls work (a and d), and quitting! The
board also doesn't add new numbers, so we've created multiple working grids in 
src/main.ml if you'd like to change which grid is run (by commenting out the others). Or make your own.

ty!
